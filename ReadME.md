# Machine Learning

Welcome to the **Machine Learning** repository! This project serves as a collection of all the machine learning models, algorithms, and techniques I have learned and implemented. The goal is to document and showcase the knowledge gained throughout the journey of learning machine learning, as well as provide an opportunity for others to explore and build upon these models.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find implementations of various machine learning algorithms, from basic to advanced models. The models (will) range from simple linear regression to deep learning techniques, and each implementation comes with an explanation of the concepts and their application.

### Key Features:
- **Model Implementations:** Code for various machine learning models such as linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, neural networks, etc.
- **Explanations and Documentation:** For each model, detailed explanations of the theory behind them and their implementation are provided.
- **Hands-on Practice:** A hands-on approach to learning and implementing machine learning models.
- **Data Exploration:** Preprocessing, cleaning, and exploration of different datasets used to train the models.

## Models Implemented

Here is a list of the models and algorithms implemented in this project:

### 1. **Linear Regression**
   - Model used for predicting continuous values.
   - Implemented using gradient descent and normal equation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code and models in this project, you need to have the following software installed:

- **Python** (3.x version recommended)
- **pip** (for installing dependencies)

You will also need to install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements

- **NumPy**: For numerical computations and matrix operations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.

The `requirements.txt` will contain the necessary dependencies to get started.

## Usage

Once you have installed the required dependencies, you can start using the models by running the Python scripts in the respective directories.

For example, to run a linear regression model, edit the main script and:

```bash
python main.py
```

Each model is organized into a folder with its own script.
